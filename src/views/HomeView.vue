            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>
                Evenly dividing labor can be difficult. Often there's not a good
                way to quantify the effort individual tasks take, and It's
                difficult to have accountability for tasks that "everyone" is
                responsible for ensuring are completed.

            <h3>The Solution</h3>
            <p>FlatList is the solution.</p>
            <p>
                FlatList allows you to ask your staff to quantify the effort
                required to complete tasks, and algorithmically generates any
                number of lists that divide the labor as evenly as possible. The
                graph of difficulty among the lists should be flat... get it? :)
